A port on a switch that has been selected to forward traffic for a specific network segment.

 When a switch receives a frame on a port that is not a designated port, it will not forward the frame back out of the same port. Instead, it will forward the frame only out of its designated ports. It prevents loops in the network topology and to ensure that frames are forwarded in the correct direction towards the root bridge.
