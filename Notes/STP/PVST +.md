A Cisco proprietary protocol that allows for the creation of a separate spanning tree instance for each [[VLAN]] in a network. Each VLAN can have its own root bridge, which ensures that traffic flows through the most efficient path for that VLAN. This eliminates the possibility of traffic being unnecessarily blocked due to a topology change in a different VLAN.
