###### What are the pros?
- Inexpensive to design and develop
- Less physical space is required
- Simple and easierr to achive

###### What are the cons?
- Von Neumann bottleneck
	The limited throughput (data transfer rate) between the central processing unit (CPU) and memory compared to the amount of memory. It is caused by the shared bus.
