# Importance of scaling a network
- To support the exchange of various types of traffic
	- Data files
	- Email
	- IP telephony
	- Video applications
- Support critical applications
- Support [[Converged network]] traffic
- Support diverse business needs
- Provide centralized administrative control

# Scaling network models
- [[Enterprise architecture]]

# Design for scalability
- Develop a strategy to enable the network to be available and to scale effectively and easily
- Use expandable, modular equipment or clustered devices that can be easily upgraded to increase capabilities
- Design a [[Hierarchical design model]] to include modules that can be added, upgraded, and modified, as necessary, without affecting the design of the other functional areas of the network.
- Create an [[IPv4]] or [[IPv6]] address strategy that is hierarchical which eliminates the need to re-address the network to support additional users and services
- Use Layer 3 devices to filter and reduce traffic to the network core ([[Core layer]])

# Planning for redunancy
Preventing disruption of network services by minimizing the possibility of a single point of failure, limiting the size of [[Failure domains]].
1. Installing duplicate equipments
2. Using reliable enterprise-class equipments
3. Providing failover services for critical devices
4. Implementing redundant paths

# Increasing bandwidth
In [[Hierarchical design model]], some links between access and distribution switches may need to process a greater amount of traffic than other links. It can be achieved by [[Link aggregation]].
