###### Why is it important to study assmbly?
- Closest language to hardware
- High level languages do not support all the hardware features
- Assembly knowledge helps to debug better
- Assembly knowledge helps to understand the execution patter of a program
- It is a valueble skill to have, since it is rare

###### What are the applications?
- Device drivers
- Low level [[Embedded System]]
- Realt time systems
- Speed critical systems
- Space critical systems

###### What are the special features?
- No pre defined data types
- Working with the program counter and the stack
- Working directly with addresses and pointer

###### What is the build process?

###### What are the hardware units used with assembly?
- [[CPU]]
- [[ALU]]
- Diverse storage unit
- Ports that control the peripherals
	- GPIO
	- Timers
	- Othe devices

###### What are the parts of assembly syntax?
- Instructions([[Mnemonics]])
- [[Directives]]
	- Start with a `.`
	- Ex:
		- `.equ`
		- `.set`
- Register names
	For [[AVR]] 8bit: R0 - R31
- Numerical values
	Ex: 
	- 56
	- 0b11010011
	- 0x5b
- Comments
	Ex:
	- `;This is a comment`
	- `#This is also a comment`
- Labels
	- Targets for jump and branch instructions
	- Must end with a `;`
	- Variable names in program memory and [[RAM]]
	- Ex:
		- `label:`
		- `test:`
- Symbols
- Syntax specifes addressing modes
