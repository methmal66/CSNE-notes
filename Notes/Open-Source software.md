###### What are the types of freedom discussed in the context of open source software?
1. The freedom to inspect or view
		 In software, this came from the freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish . Access to the source code is a precondition for this - such as FreeCAD files, text documents, spreadsheets, calculations, instructions, etc.
2. The freedom to use
		Run or otherwise execute the software, product, or process. You may be charged for using the thing. But this is a moot point, because as soon as someone buys it, it can be released for free. 
3. The freedom to modify
		This is a big point: making improvements or adaptation is a key to distributing value.
4. Economic freedom
		The freedom to distribute or sell. Freedom distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
