#hardware #ES 
A combination of computer [[Hardware]] and [[Software]] designed to perform a specific function. A special purpose computer system designed to perform one or few dedicated functions

###### Examples
- Digital camera
- Refrigerator
- Microwave oven
- Washing machine
- TV and TV/remote
- Home router

###### On what components ES are based?
- [[Microcontroller]]
- [[Microprocessor]]

###### What is the difference between microprocessor and microcontroller
The key difference is the Microprocessor consists of only a Central Processing Unit, whereas the Microcontroller contains a CPU, Memory, I/O all integrated into one chip.

| Microcontroller                        | Microprocessor                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Requires other peripherals to function | Chip is self contained. Don't need extra peripherals           |
| Used in ES                             | Mostly used in personal computers, can be used with ES as well |
| Uses an internal controlling [[Bus]]   | Uses an external bus                                           |
| Based on [[Harvard Architecture]]      | Based on [[Von Neumann Architecture]]                          |
| Straightforward                        | Complicated                                                    |
| Inexpensive                            | Expensive                                                      |
| Memory and I/O are already present     | Memory and I/O has to be connected externally                  |
| Low power consumption                  | High power consumption                                         |
| Consist of less registers              | Consist of more registers                                      |
|Slow. Clock speed is above 200MHZ|  Fast. [[Clock speed]] is above 1GHz                                        |
|                                        |                                                                |
