VLAN 1 of a switch is the system default. It is used to management purposes, every interface is already assigend to that VLAN. We are supposed to reassign them. Other VLANs from 1002-1005 are also used for system purposes, but not interfaces are assigned to them.
They can be configured in either [[Static .|static]] or [[Dynamic .|dynamic]].
